# Pegasus Web Project

In this project we will be deploying the website for Pegasus.

We will be using the flask framework for backend.

## How to contribute to the project?
### Commit protocol

Every time you work on the project, pull to your local environment from the repository.

Every user will have a personal branch for pushing into the repository. DO NOT dump your work into the master branch.

An additional branch called development, will be created to merge all the code into it BEFORE merging into master. The development branch is intended for group revisions that will determine if the code goes to master or not.

The master branch will then consistently contain the project in the latest approved state, i.e. after a particular feature has been added, tested, and it works without breaking something else.
